    <!-- Chosen Palette: Warm Neutral Harmony -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The application is designed as a top-down strategic dashboard. It starts with the highest-level summary (The Strategic Dichotomy and Recommended Roadmap), allowing users to immediately grasp the report's conclusions. The core of the app is an interactive Vendor Comparison Dashboard where users can filter and sort vendor "cards" based on key attributes. Clicking a card opens a detailed modal view with tabbed navigation, allowing for a deep dive without losing context. This is supported by a dynamic bar chart for direct visual comparison of quantitative metrics. This layered, interactive structure was chosen to transform a dense, linear report into an exploratory tool that supports strategic decision-making, catering to users who need a quick overview as well as those who require granular details. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: Report data is transformed for clarity and interaction. The vendor comparison table becomes interactive cards (Goal: Organize/Compare, Method: HTML/CSS/JS Filter, Justification: Easier to scan and filter than a static table). A dynamic bar chart (Goal: Compare, Method: Chart.js/Canvas, Justification: Provides instant visual comparison of quantified metrics like API maturity) allows users to switch between different comparison points. The detailed vendor text is broken into tabs within a modal (Goal: Inform, Method: JS show/hide, Justification: Prevents information overload and improves readability). The strategic roadmap is presented as a visual stepper (Goal: Inform, Method: HTML/CSS, Justification: More engaging and easier to follow than a list). All choices prioritize user interaction and comprehension. -->
    <!-- CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->
