    <!-- Chosen Palette: Warm Neutrals -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The SPA is designed as an interactive dashboard, diverging from the linear report format for better usability. The structure is: 1) A header with a summary. 2) A "National Overview" section with a key findings chart and interactive cards for the report's main themes. This synthesizes the executive summary and thematic analysis into a more engaging format. 3) An interactive "State-by-State Deep Dive" section, using tabs for state selection to dynamically display facility data. This replaces the long, scrolling text sections and allows users to directly access the information they need. 4) An "Understanding the Regulations" section with clickable F-Tags to provide context on-demand. 5) A final "Advocate's Guide" section presenting the actionable questions in a clear, usable format. This top-down structure (from national overview to specific details) provides a logical, user-driven exploration path, making complex information digestible and accessible. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 1. National Findings (Doughnut Chart): Goal: Inform/Compare. Method: Chart.js Doughnut. Interaction: Hover for details. Justification: Visually represents the core finding of Explicit vs. Implicit failures for an immediate high-level takeaway. 2. Thematic Analysis (Interactive Cards): Goal: Inform/Organize. Method: HTML/CSS/JS clickable cards. Interaction: Click to reveal details in a modal. Justification: Converts dense paragraphs into an engaging, interactive exploration of key concepts. 3. State/Facility Data (Dynamic Tabs/Accordions): Goal: Organize/Compare. Method: JS-driven content switching and HTML accordions. Interaction: Click tabs to switch states, click facilities to expand details. Justification: Manages a large amount of hierarchical data cleanly, preventing information overload and allowing focused user queries. 4. Regulatory F-Tags (Clickable List): Goal: Inform. Method: HTML/JS modal. Interaction: Click tag to see definition. Justification: Provides context-sensitive help ("just-in-time" information) without cluttering the main interface. All choices use JS for dynamic updates, avoiding static pages and enhancing user engagement. -->

In cases like Paoli Health (IN) and Careone At New Milford (NJ), inspection reports documented explicit training failures in one year, which were followed by serious, harm-level deficiencies for abuse and accident prevention in the subsequent year. This demonstrates that regulatory failures in process-oriented standards are not trivial administrative lapses; they are warnings of a system\'s decay that, if left uncorrected, will predictably lead to dangerous outcomes for residents.' },

The sheer volume and repetition of abuse-related deficiencies is, in itself, evidence of a systemic competency failure. This highlights the need to perform an "implicit analysis" when evaluating a facility. Patterns of repeated falls, multiple abuse allegations, or widespread infections should be viewed as de facto evidence of an inadequately trained or supervised workforce, regardless of whether a specific training tag was cited.' },

The Grand at Guilderland in New York, with its 52.9% nurse turnover rate alongside repeated citations for both staffing and competency, serves as a stark case study. High turnover strains training resources, leading to poorly prepared staff. This substandard care contributes to a stressful work environment and poor outcomes, which in turn drives more staff to leave. The combination of high turnover and competency deficiencies is one of the most significant red flags.' },
                theme4: { title: 'Administrative Culpability as the Root Cause', body: 'Ultimately, the responsibility for ensuring a competent workforce lies with facility administration. In facilities like Charlotte Bay (FL) and St Luke (NY), administrative deficiencies were cited in direct conjunction with care failures. Administrative decisions to cut staffing and training, often seen as controllable costs, have a direct and detrimental impact on the quality and safety of resident care.
